# TraceOrigin

This is the frontend for the TraceOrigin project, a capstone created by a group of K16 students from FPT University Hanoi. OriginTrace is a website designed for businesses to track the life cycle of their products by recording each transaction in a diary format. The main technology we use is ReactJS.

## Demo

To visit the demo of the web application, you can go to: [Demo URL](https://trace-origin.netlify.app/)

## Key Technologies

Some key technologies we use in this project include:

- **QR Code Generation**: Used for creating unique QR codes for each product to facilitate easy tracking and management using QRcode React.
- **AI Image Classification**: Implemented to automatically categorize product images, improving the efficiency of the tracking process using TensorflowJS.
- **3D Showcase**: Allow to add 3d files design to show that product's model using ThreeJS.

## Features

- **Product Tracking**: Track the entire lifecycle of products from manufacturing to delivery.
- **Transaction Diary**: Record detailed events associated with each product, ensuring transparency and traceability.
- **Interactive Timeline**: Visualize the product journey with an interactive timeline feature.
- **AI Integration**: Enhance product categorization and management with AI-powered image classification.
